## DIVORCE PREDICTION APP
This project was done as part of my #100 Days of code challenge. One thing I planned on learning during this challenge was deploying a model. During the week, I got familiar with sreamlit and heroku and this app is basically what I learned. 


The app is a form that takes input from users and tells you if you are likely to get a divorce.


# OBJECTIVES
 1. Build a model that can predict the likelihood of divorce
 2.Make a streamlit app
 3. Deploy the app to heroku
